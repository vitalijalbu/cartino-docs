## Why Extend Cartino?

### Custom Business Logic
Add features specific to your business requirements without modifying core code.

### Third-Party Integrations

### Custom Admin UI
Build custom admin interfaces for managing your unique data and workflows.

### Reusable Packages
Create packages that can be shared across projects or with the community.

## Extension Architecture

Cartino follows Laravel's architecture patterns:

```
cartino/
├── app/
│   ├── Extensions/           # Your custom extensions
│   │   ├── PaymentGateways/
│   │   ├── ShippingProviders/
│   │   └── CustomModels/
│   ├── Providers/
│   │   └── ExtensionServiceProvider.php
│   └── Http/
│       └── Controllers/
│           └── Extensions/
├── resources/
│   └── js/
│       ├── components/       # Custom Vue components
│       ├── pages/            # Custom admin pages
│       └── plugins/          # Vue plugins
└── packages/                 # Custom packages
    └── your-package/
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Backend Extension

Create a custom model extension:

```php
// app/Extensions/CustomModels/Subscription.php
namespace App\Extensions\CustomModels;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Subscription extends Model
{
    protected $fillable = ['customer_id', 'plan', 'status'];
    
    public function customer()
    {
        return $this->belongsTo(Customer::class);
    }
}
```

### 2. Frontend Extension

Create a custom Vue component:

```vue
<!-- resources/js/components/SubscriptionManager.vue -->
<template>
  <ui-card>
    <ui-card-header>
      <ui-card-title>Subscriptions</ui-card-title>
    </ui-card-header>
    <ui-card-content>
      <ui-table :data="subscriptions" />
    </ui-card-content>
  </ui-card>
</template>

<script setup lang="ts">
const subscriptions = ref([])

const loadSubscriptions = async () => {
  subscriptions.value = await $fetch('/api/subscriptions')
}

onMounted(loadSubscriptions)
</script>
```

### 3. Register Extensions

```php
// app/Providers/ExtensionServiceProvider.php
namespace App\Providers;

use Illuminate\Support\ServiceProvider;

class ExtensionServiceProvider extends ServiceProvider
{
    public function register(): void
    {
        // Register services
    }
    
    public function boot(): void
    {
        // Load routes, views, migrations
        $this->loadMigrationsFrom(__DIR__.'/../Extensions/migrations');
        $this->loadRoutesFrom(__DIR__.'/../Extensions/routes.php');
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Use Service Providers
Organize your extensions using Laravel service providers.

### Follow Naming Conventions
Keep your code consistent with Cartino's conventions.

### Write Tests
Test your extensions to ensure they work correctly.

### Document Your Code
Provide clear documentation for your extensions.

### Version Control
Use semantic versioning for package releases.
