# Start building e-commerce with Laravel

We are delighted you are considering **Cartino** for your project. We've spent a lot of time developing this platform to bring powerful, flexible e-commerce functionality to Laravel with an exceptional developer experience.

## What is Cartino?

Cartino is a modern **Laravel e-commerce platform** that combines the power of Laravel with a beautiful admin panel built on **Inertia.js** and **Vue 3**. You have complete freedom to create your own storefront(s), while we've already done the hard work for you in the backend and admin interface.

Think of it as bringing the best ideas from **Statamic CMS**, **Laravel Nova**, and **Shopify** together into one cohesive e-commerce solution.

## Tech Stack

Cartino is built on a modern, battle-tested technology stack:

### Backend
- **Laravel 12** - The PHP framework for web artisans
- **Inertia.js** - Modern monolith architecture (no API needed)
- **Spatie Packages** - Battle-tested tools for permissions, media, and more

### Admin Panel
- **Vue 3** - Composition API for reactive UIs
- **Pinia** - State management
- **Reka UI** - Headless components for accessibility
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework
- **TypeScript** - Type safety and better DX

### Storefront
- **Blade Templates** - Server-side rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Alpine.js** - Optional lightweight interactivity

## Key Features

Cartino brings enterprise-level e-commerce features to Laravel:

- **Blueprint System** - Statamic-inspired custom fields for products, customers, and orders
- **Multi-Channel Sales** - Sell across multiple websites, currencies, and languages
- **Advanced Inventory** - Multi-location inventory with stock movements
- **Flexible Pricing** - Channel-specific, customer group, and variant pricing
- **Cart & Checkout** - Powerful cart engine with discount and coupon support
- **Customer Management** - Customer groups, addresses, and order history
- **Developer First** - Clean APIs, extensible architecture, and great documentation

## What are the future plans?

- 🚀 Continuous innovation and new features
- 📦 Growing ecosystem of addons and integrations
- 🎨 Beautiful, customizable themes
- 🌍 Multi-tenant SaaS capabilities
- 📱 Progressive Web App support
- 🤝 Strong community and commercial support
