Cartino's data model is inspired by Shopify's commerce architecture, adapted for Laravel's ecosystem with powerful JSONB support for custom fields.

## Core Models

### Products & Catalog
- [Product](/models/product) - Product container with variants
- [ProductVariant](/models/product-variant) - Sellable SKU with inventory
- [VariantPrice](/models/variant-price) - Multi-currency pricing rules

### Orders & Carts
- [Cart](/models/cart) - Shopping cart with line items
- [CartItem](/models/cart-item) - Cart line items
- [Order](/models/order) - Completed order
- [OrderItem](/models/order-item) - Order line items

### Customers
- [Customer](/models/customer) - Customer account
- [CustomerGroup](/models/customer-group) - Pricing and segmentation groups
- [Address](/models/address) - Shipping and billing addresses

### Inventory
- [InventoryItem](/models/inventory-item) - Inventory tracking entity
- [InventoryLevel](/models/inventory-level) - Stock levels per location
- [Location](/models/location) - Warehouse/store locations
- [StockMovement](/models/stock-movement) - Stock transaction audit

### Pricing & Discounts
- [Discount](/models/discount) - Promotional discounts
- [Coupon](/models/coupon) - Discount coupon codes

### Loyalty

## Database Conventions

### Primary Keys
All models use `id` as the primary key (unsigned big integer).

### Timestamps
All models include:
- `created_at` - Record creation timestamp
- `updated_at` - Last modification timestamp

### Soft Deletes
Most models support soft deletes with `deleted_at` timestamp.

### JSONB Fields
Models use `data` column for custom fields and metadata:

```php
$product->data = [
    'custom_field' => 'value',
    'metadata' => ['key' => 'value']
];
```

### Naming Conventions
- **Tables**: plural snake_case (e.g., `product_variants`)
- **Models**: singular PascalCase (e.g., `ProductVariant`)
- **Foreign keys**: singular with `_id` (e.g., `product_id`)
- **Pivot tables**: alphabetical order (e.g., `customer_customer_group`)

## Relationships

### One-to-Many
```php
// Product has many variants
$product->variants;

// Customer has many orders
$customer->orders;
```

### Many-to-Many
```php
// Customer belongs to many groups
$customer->groups;

// Product belongs to many categories
$product->categories;
```

### Polymorphic
```php
// Address can belong to customer or order
$address->addressable;

// Media can belong to any model
$model->media;
```
